# Autonomous Drone-Based Real-Time Maritime Search and Rescue Using Onboard CV and Precision Payload Deployment

This project implements an autonomous UAV-based system for real-time maritime Search and Rescue (SAR) operations using onboard computer vision models. The system is capable of responding to emergency alerts, autonomously navigating to GPS-tagged distress locations, performing aerial object detection to locate victims (specifically swimmers), and initiating a precision payload drop (life buoy), all while running on edge-compatible hardware.
The core innovation lies in deploying highly efficient object detection models (YOLOv8n and YOLOv11n) optimized for inference on constrained platforms such as drones. These models were trained and evaluated on a curated and augmented version of the SeaDronesSee dataset. The detection pipeline is supported by GPS, IMU-based navigation, and temporal tracking for spatial confirmation, forming a closed-loop UAV SAR system.

### Observations

- Swimmer class performance is critical for SAR ‚Äî YOLOv8n marginally outperforms YOLOv11n in F1.
- Boats and Jetskis are detected with high confidence due to their large, distinct shapes.
- Life-saving appliances perform poorly due to small object size, occlusion, and underrepresentation in training data.

### Visual Examples

Included in the repository are inference outputs (bounding boxes on video frames) from both:
- **Synthetic test data**
- **Real-world maritime scenarios** (e.g., open sea, coastal crowds)

### Model Selection Criteria

- **YOLOv8n** is preferred for Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano, or Xavier NX deployments.
- **YOLOv11s** may be considered if additional compute power is available (higher mAP, 21.3 GFLOPs).
